# Projects

- ***Trevor***
  - Typically, within zero involvement pairing and authentication (ZIPA) systems, environmental signals must be synchronized before key generation takes place. This is usually done through the use of a synchronization buffer. Synchronization buffers contain samples that will not be used in key generation but are sent over an unsecured channel to be used in a synchronization process with other devices. This sharing of a synchronization buffer between devices poses a security risk as it divulges information about signal being used in the key generation process. Furthermore, it also poses a performance issue as well since the sharing of the synchronization buffer slows down the key generation significantly. With *Trevor*, we seek to eliminate the need for synchronization buffers by generating keys through time resistant feature in the environmental signal.
- ***Usermode Containerization***
  - Containers like Docker need root privilege when starting a container regardless if the container will be run completely in usermode or not. Adversaries have used this temporary period of time to perform what is known as container escapes. A container escape is when a malicious process is able to break out during the start up phase of container creation and maintain full root privilege. To avoid this, the *Usermode Containerization* project seeks to create an alternative container to typical containers that runs completely in usermode. Hence, adversaries are unable to take advantage of container escapes.
