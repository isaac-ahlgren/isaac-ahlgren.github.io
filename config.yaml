    description: |
      I am a lead graduate student for the Software and Systems Laboratory (SSL) at Loyola University Chicago.
      Currently finishing up a Masters in Computer Science at Loyola University Chicago and looking to apply to PhD schools in the upcoming cycle. 

      My research interests have broadly revolved around privacy and security for software and systems. But, I am particularly interested in the **security and privacy of embedded systems, Internet of Things, Cyber-Physical systems, and hardware security**.
      My work currently has to do with developing scalable authentication systems for IoT devices.

        company: Loyola University Chicago
        details: |1-
          - Lead graduate student in the Software and Systems Laboratory who mentored four students on a large scale project. The mentorship was awarded with the Graduate Research Mentorship Award.
          - Developed a cluster of research IoT authentication systems using custom PCBs and Raspberry Pis connected to a variety of sensors. Software was written in Python and C where each system uses Avahi, OpenVPN, and Ansible to automatically set up communication between devices.
          - Worked within the Linux kernel to research virtualization techniques for mitigating container escape security vulnerabilities in technologies like Docker.
          - Worked with ESP32 and NORA-B1 microcontrollers to modify wireless communication protocols like WiFi or Bluetooth.
          - Helped instruct Computer Systems and Operating Systems classes.
      - position: Embedded Software Engineer Intern
        dates: May 2021 - August 2021
        company: Motorola Solutions
        details: |1-
          - Researched and modeled an radio frequency anomaly detection algorithm in Python.
          - Developed anomaly detection system with a software-defined radio.
          - Thoroughly documented approaches to the algorithm as well as future possible approaches to the algorithm.
